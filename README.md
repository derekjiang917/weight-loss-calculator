# weight-loss-calculator

Calculate how long it will take to get to your ideal bodyfat percentage, and how many calories you need to eat daily to get there.

I was really annoyed at having to manually calculate all these numbers every time my weight changed, so I created this little webapp using Flask. I incorporated a little database too because Isaac told me to. After learning about HTML and CSS, I wanted to be able to combine that with my python skills to create a simple webapp.
